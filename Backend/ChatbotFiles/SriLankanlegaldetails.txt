Sri Lanka Legal System Overview
Sri Lanka’s legal system is a unique blend of Roman-Dutch law, English common law, and customary laws influenced by its colonial history and multicultural society.
The country was under Portuguese rule from 1505 to 1658, followed by Dutch rule until 1796, and British rule until independence in 1948.
Roman-Dutch law forms the backbone of civil law, while English law heavily influences criminal and commercial law.
Customary laws, such as Kandyan law for Sinhalese in the Central Province and Muslim personal law, apply to specific communities.
The Constitution of 1978 is the supreme law, establishing a unitary state with a presidential system and parliamentary democracy.
The judiciary includes the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Courts, District Courts, and Magistrate’s Courts.
Legislation is enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the highest law-making authority.

Criminal law is primarily governed by the Penal Code of 1883, enacted during British rule and amended over time.
Section 296 defines murder, punishable by death or life imprisonment.

Criminal cases begin with a police complaint or private plaint filed in the Magistrate’s Court.
Serious offenses, like murder, are tried in the High Court with or without a jury.
The Code of Criminal Procedure 1979 outlines trial processes, evidence rules, and appeals.
